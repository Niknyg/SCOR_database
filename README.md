The National Child Odontology Register (SCOR), has, since 1972, collected data on the oral health of nearly all Danish children down to a tooth-surface level. 

The approach to registering dental caries has not changed much since the registers conception in 1972, meanwhile the guidelines for registering gingivitis and periodontitis have changed considerably, which one should be aware of when using these data.
